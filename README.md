# catalog-manager

The NAPPTIVE Catalog manager is the component responsible for providing a centralized repository to store application specifications aiming to facilitate the distribution and reusability of Cloud Native applications. Applications are expected to contain [OAM](https://oam.dev) entites with the addition of a new metadata entity to improve the user experience when navigating through the catalog.

## Getting started

* [Using the catalog as part of the NAPPTIVE Playground](https://docs.napptive.com/Catalog.html) (SaaS)
* [Hosting your own private catalog](docs/guides/PrivateCatalog.md)
  * [Kind](docs/guides/PrivateCatalogOnKind.md)
* [First steps](docs/guides/FirstSteps.md)

## Development

To run unit tests use:

```
make test
```

To run integration tests, first launch a docker container with elasticsearch and postgresql.

```
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:7.11.2
docker run -d --name local-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Pass2020 -p 5432:5432 postgres:13-alpine
```

Next, you need to preload the database table definitions:

```
docker exec -it local-postgres psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS catalog;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS catalog.users (
  username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  salt VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
  salted_password VARCHAR(256)
);
```

then execute:

```
RUN_INTEGRATION_TEST=all make test
```
